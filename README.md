## Toby's Dotfiles ##
Your dotfiles personalise your system; these are mine.

### dotfiles ###
As a system administrator, I log on to a lot of different servers.  I need to centralise and standardise my customisation; this repository will allow me to do this easily.

Feel free to fork this repository and hack it around to your tastes.  I'll endeavour to include lots of comments to explain what is going on.

### bugs ###
If you find something isn't working as you expected, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tobygale/dotfiles/issues) on this repository, I'd love to fix it for you!
